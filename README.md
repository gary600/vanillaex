# VanillaEX
VanillaEX is a Minecraft data pack that adds various items and machines to make the game more automated.

## Installation
To install VanillaEX, clone or download this repository and move that folder to your data packs folder:  
Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\saves\*worldname*\datapacks`  
MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/*worldname*/datapacks`  
Linux: `~/.minecraft/saves/*worldname*/datapacks`  

After it's installed, open up you Minecraft world and enable and start the pack:
```
/datapack enable "folder/vanillaex"
/function vex:start
```
After that, you're all done! Check out the Wiki for info on how to make the machines, etc.

## Removal
If you want to remove VanillaEX from the world, simply run `/function vex:remove`.  
Keep in mind, **this will remove all VanillaEX machines from the world**.
